## IPTV Contributing Guide

There are few guidelines to keep in mind when you want to contribute to IPTV
project.

First thing First, legal part:

- **Do not** use explicit servers name, we don't want to sell data of the IPTV services itself.
- **Do not** store data inside the `output` folder.
- **Do not** ask for accounts using the issues or pull request system.

Once you accept those requirements let's start talking about python code.

We are following the [PEP-008](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) as coding
standards and [PEP-0257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/) for the Docstring
conventions.
