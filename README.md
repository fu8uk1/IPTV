Disclaimer This program is just a demonstration. It's not intended for personal purpose.  What is this? IPTV is a simple python program that let you crawl the search engines in order to fetch those sites that stream illegal tv programs.  This script leverage the fact the a lot of those sites use the same CMS to create the web application and sharing the service, behind a CMS there's always some exploits. We are using one simple exploit to grab and crawl the site's url and use for our purpose, we have discovered a lot of those exploits.  Ethical Dilemma Even though those services are illegal, stealing from a thief is still stealing.  Using this program for your personal use is illegal.
